    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>In this life, I have many hobbies. For example, I love to read. Not boring old non-fiction or extremely cliche fantasy books that lead to pointless nowhere, but actual genuine realistic-fiction that actually brings a tear to my eye.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy playing games... The cool electronic ones such as online RPGs or first-person shooters. Not like the really weird ones like that one game where you try to shoot balls into nets (what genius thought of that one?). I think it was called socker</p>

    <p>As you can probably already see or realize, I also enjoy being either extremely smart, extremely dumb, or extremely humble.</p>
    <p>And obviously, being sarcastic, lying, and annoying people are all my specialties as well. For example, this page will surely cause you eye cancer. Therefore, I sincerely wish you the best of luck paying for your hospital bills and pls do not sue me.</p>

    <p>I hope that you genuinely have not read any of what was said above because then you will obviously be enamored and will become my stalker (which I do not apreciate)</p>
