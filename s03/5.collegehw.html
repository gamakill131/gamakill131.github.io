    <h1>My Favorable/Wanted College</h1>
    <p>The college that I would most likely want to go is McDonalds College. It seems like a great-great place to put all of my skills to highly intensive work and push them to their ut-most limits. I assure you that I am not just writing <strong>gibberish</strong>, and I have actually put thought into this. Also, be warned that this site will contain fake ads... Maybe if I'm not lazy.</p>
    <p>Another reason for wanting to go to this type of place is because, it just seems right. I feel tha the people who would go to this college would have around the same IQ as I, as well as the same amount of skill in all factors. Therefore, I feel that this is the perfect college for me.</p>
